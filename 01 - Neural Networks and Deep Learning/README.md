# [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/home/week/1)

## How did this course enhance my Data Science skills?
- I know how a neural network is composed, both a shallow or a deep one. Moreover, I understand its mathematical representation.
- I can build a deep neural network from scratch in Python and implementing vectorization techniques.
- I understand the most common activation functions (ReLu, hyperbolic tangent, Softmax, Sigmoid, Leaky ReLu) and how to choose the best for each layer of my network. Moreover, I understand why we need non-linear activation functions in a nerual network.
- I am familiar with the random initialization concept, I know why it's done and how to implement it.
- I deeply understood the mathematical foundation of backpropagation, which is the reason why we are able to build functioning networks.
